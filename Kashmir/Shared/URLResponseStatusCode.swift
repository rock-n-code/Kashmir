	// MARK: - Enumerations
	
	/// Status code numeric enumeration of the status code received from URLResponse for *HTTP/1.1* in a request-response between a client and a server.
	///
	/// - **ok**: (*200*) Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
	/// - **created**: (*201*) The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
	/// - **noContest**: (*204*) The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.
	/// - **unauthorized**: (*401*) Similar to *forbidden*, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
	/// - **forbidden**: (*403*) The request was a valid request, but the server is refusing to respond to it. The user might be logged in but does not have the necessary permissions for the resource.
	/// - **notFound**: (*404*) The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
	/// - **methodNotAllowed**: (*405*) A request method is not supported for the requested resource; for example, a GET request on a form which requires data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource.
	/// - **unprocessableEntity**: (*422*) The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.
	/// - **internalServerError**: (*500*) A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
